When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
One reason would be when working with a team of developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you only want to push working code to your remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 
Fork takes a repo from GitHub and copies it into your own GitHub account. Cloning takes a repo from GitHub or a Local repo and makes a copy of it. Branching allows you to divert from master branch create new features and experiment on the code base. I would fork when I want to contribute to an open source project for example. I would clone when I want to get a copy of that fork onto my local machine. I would branch as soon as I want to start development on some new feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Changes do not affect the remote repository, and allows you freedom to make experimental changes.
